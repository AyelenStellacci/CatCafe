        <h2>OUR MICHIS</h2>
        <p>
          Before bringing them to their new home, we introduced them to each other and watched them grow together, playing and having fun as a litter. The only selection we made was based on their character, to ensure they would thrive in a unique environment like a café-bistro with a constant flow of people. <br>
          Now they are the undisputed hosts of the Cat Café, but it hasn't been an easy task! Everything has been designed for their psychophysical well-being: from their integration to the café's schedule and the maximum number of people allowed inside. Even the furnishings have been created with their ethological needs in mind, with scratching posts, logs, toys, and pathways for them to jump and climb on, along with a private area for their rest, away from prying eyes.<br>
          We have always sought the guidance of veterinarians and feline behavior experts to ensure their well-being. We aim to be a role model for all who follow us, providing insights and advice on how to best interact with these adorable little felines. <br>

          <img src="../recursos/gatos/blondie.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Blondie</h4>
          <p>Bianca, with a few black spots, narrow and amber eyes, Blondie has the attitude of an '80s rock diva. Always elegantly slow, she may seem lazy, but as soon as she spots a toy in motion, she's the first in line for jumps and acrobatics. She and Mina are sisters and come from the organization Cats on the Road. Blondie also has a love for food and adores being around people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/bowie.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Bowie</h4>
          <p>With ice-blue eyes and a cappuccino-colored coat, Bowie is our little stranger who hails from the Trentino mountains. He was the only one in his litter who hadn't found a home, but he was warmly welcomed by the entire colony! Bowie is always on the lookout for crumbs and snacks, and he enjoys playfully pouncing and endlessly playing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/elton.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Elton</h4>
          <p>White and ginger with semi-long fur, Elton is undoubtedly the sweetest cat in the entire colony, which is why he earned a romantic name in honor of Elton John. His love for music often leads him to peacefully nap on a stack of vinyl records, but he doesn't mind the keyboard or other unusual places! He and his brother Jimmy come from the organization Friends of Eddie. Elton also has a lazy streak that he quite enjoys.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/elvis.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Elvis</h4>
          <p>Elvis, with a grey tabby coat, has an Egyptian-like appearance, long and sleek with a tapered snout. Though he appears cautious, don't be deceived by his inquisitive eyes - he's a sweet cat who enjoys approaching, sniffing, and, if fortunate, allowing belly rubs! At times, he feels lonely and calls out to the whole colony, inviting you to respond. He is Patti's brother from the Cats on the Road organization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/freddie.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Freddie</h4>
          <p>White with grey spots, Freddie is our unique little cyclops! Despite losing one eye to an infection as a kitten, he remains playful, adventurous, and adores cuddles. Often found napping near the litter box, he seeks affection at every opportunity. Freddie, named after Freddie Mercury, is truly one of a kind! He comes from the Anubis clinic in Pogliano Milanese.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/jimmy.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Jimmy</h4>
          <p>Velvet grey, he almost resembles a Chartreux, but he is a European stray like his brother Elton. When awake, he leaps, runs, and engages in daring ambushes, but his sleep is impervious to any noise. Nicknamed "Acciughina," his real name is Jimi, in honor of the great Hendrix! He also comes from the Friends of Eddie organization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/Joey.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Joey</h4>
          <p>Black as pitch with big round yellow eyes, Joey is our little hero. Affected by a fox trap, he lost his tail and right hind leg. But don't pity him - our three-legged champ jumps, runs, plays, and attacks just like any other cat! He has the attitude of a true punk rocker and we could only name him after the great singer of the Ramones. Like Freddie, he comes from the Anubis clinic in Pogliano Milanese.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/mina.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Mina</h4>
          <p>With a tricolor coat and amber eyes, she is the toughest cat in the colony. Always exploring forbidden places, she takes long naps on the armchair, posing to be admired and photographed. Like the great Italian singer, Mina is a diva, judging you and granting you the privilege of cuddling her occasionally. She and Blondie are sisters from the Cats on the Road organization.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-gato">
          <img src="../recursos/gatos/patti.png" alt="Picture of our cats">
          <h4>Patty</h4>
          <p>Seemingly small and docile, Patty with her grey tabby coat is actually a cat with a strong and independent personality. She loves cuddles so much that she demands them loudly (and persistently!). Don't be fooled by her pleading eyes, refrain from giving her any food. Like Patti Smith, she is a free spirit that will easily make you fall in love. She is Elvis's sister, and they come from the Cats on the Road organization.</p>

          <h2>Remember our rules!</h2>
          <p>We are confident in your cooperation, but in the event that these behaviors 
            are not respected, we will be forced to ask you to leave the premises.</p>

              <h3 class="titulo">A relaxed environment</h3>
              <p>The cats are the hosts, and like all cats, they appreciate a relaxed and quiet environment. Shouting and loud noises should be avoided to prevent triggering any instinctive reactions typical of a frightened cat. Additionally, we recommend our guests not to use flash when taking photographs.</p>

              <h3 class="titulo">Children</h3>
              <p>We are delighted to witness interactions between our little furry friends and your little ones. However, children under 12 years old must be supervised by parents or guardians, and they too must read and adhere to the rules. Very young children are discouraged: screams and crying can greatly frighten our cats.

              <h3 class="titulo">Do not overwhelm them</h3>
              <p>Cats are independent animals. They are not stuffed toys to be picked up at will. Instead, let's approach them slowly, allowing ourselves to be seen and sniffed. Let's wait for them to let us know if they want to play, be cuddled, or be admired.</p>

              <h3 class="titulo">Respect their sleep</h3>
              <p>Cats are nocturnal predators, and during the day, they need to recharge with long periods of sleep (up to 12 hours!). Admire them in their contortionist positions without disturbing their rest with petting or play and keeping your voice tone low.</p>

              <h3>Don't feed them</h3>
              <p>Don't trust their pleading eyes; they have a full stomach, and high-quality food is always available to them. Additionally, some dishes that are healthy for us can be toxic to them, such as onions or chocolate. Don't use food to lure them, as it may encourage a wrong habit.</p>

              <p>Our cats love to play, but we kindly ask you to only use the toys provided and not use your hands. This small precaution will make them feel comfortable and prevent our guests from unexpected scratches!</p>

              <h3>No animals allowed</h3>
              <p>Cats are very territorial and would not take kindly to the invasion of other animals. Therefore, the entry of other cats is not permitted. For the same reason, dogs or other animals are also not allowed.</p>

              <p>All dishes and beverages are prepared and stored in areas inaccessible to the cats. The premises are cleaned every day, both in the morning and evening, ensuring a consistently fresh and clean environment.</p>
